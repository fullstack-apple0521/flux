# Flux v2

Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of
configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to
configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux version 2 ("Flux v2") is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes'
API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core
components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. In version 2, Flux supports
multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git
repositories, among other long-requested features.

Flux v2 is constructed with the [GitOps Toolkit](components/index.md),
a set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous
Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

## Who is Flux for?

Flux helps

- **cluster operators** who automate provision and configuration of clusters;
- **platform engineers** who build continuous delivery for developer teams;
- **app developers** who rely on continuous delivery to get their code live.

The [GitOps Toolkit](components/index.md) is for **platform
engineers** who want to make their own continuous delivery system, and
have requirements not covered by Flux.

## What can I do with Flux?

Flux is based on a set of Kubernetes API extensions ("custom
resources"), which control how git repositories and other sources of
configuration are applied into the cluster ("synced").
For example, you create a `GitRepository` object to mirror
configuration from a Git repository, then a `Kustomization` object to
sync that configuration.

Flux works with Kubernetes' role-based access control (RBAC), so you
can lock down what any particular sync can change. It can send
notifications to Slack and other like systems when configuration is
synced and ready, and receive webhooks to tell it when to sync.

The `flux` command-line tool is a convenient way to bootstrap the
system in a cluster, and to access the custom resources that make up
the API.

## Where do I start?

!!! hint "Get started with Flux v2!"
    Following this [guide](get-started/index.md) will just take a couple of minutes to complete:
    After installing the `flux` CLI and running a couple of very simple commands,
    you will have a GitOps workflow setup which involves a staging and a production cluster.

If you should need help, please refer to our **[Support page](https://fluxcd.io/support/)**.
