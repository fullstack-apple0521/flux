The maintainers are generally available in Slack at
https://cloud-native.slack.com in #flux (https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CLAJ40HV3)
(obtain an invitation at https://slack.cncf.io/).

These maintainers are shared with other Flux v2-related git
repositories under https://github.com/fluxcd, as noted in their
respective MAINTAINERS files.

For convenience, they are reflected in the GitHub team
@fluxcd/flux2-maintainers -- if the list here changes, that team also
should.
